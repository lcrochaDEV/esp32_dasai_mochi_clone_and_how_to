> [ENGLISH] This project is a clone of Dasai Mochi, the adorable animated character made popular on YouTube. Designed to run on the ESP32 microcontroller, the system renders animated emotes on a TFT display by converting GIFs to C++ code using the powerful tool gif2cpp.


####   Project highlights:
- Displaying animated Mochi emotes on oled screen
-  Using gif2cpp (https://huykhong.com/IOT/gif2cpp) to convert GIFs into lightweight C++ arrays
-  Built on ESP32 
-  Runs smooth 15 FPS animations on ILI9341 / ST7789 displays
-  Ideal for robotic expressions, smart assistants, or pure cuteness


#### What is gif2cpp?
- https://huykhong.com/IOT/gif2cpp
- gif2cpp is an open-source tool that converts animated GIFs into C++ header files – perfect for embedding animations in microcontroller projects where you can't use real-time video formats.


#### How to use:

1. Extract emote sections using ffmpeg: (Example commands included)
 `→ ffmpeg -ss ... -to ... -i full.mp4 ... -y emote.gif`
3. Run gif2cpp to generate .h file
4.  Include in your ESP32 project.
